## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I had to try to use android studio without emulator so I did it by connecting usb cable into my android device to see whether the app functions properly or not. I had to ensure that the texts are visible whenever user is scrolling down.
